    <p>The dish is believed to be of Tibetan origin and since then <br>
      has spread to <br> neighbouring countries,along with the influx of the tibetan diaspora.</p>
    <p>Originally,the filling of the dish was typicallymeat,such as YAK,due to scarcity<br> of
      vegetables in Tibet.</p>
    <p>However, after arriving in other neighbouring countries, the momo was made vegetarian<br> in
