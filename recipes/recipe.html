    <p>The dish is believed to be of Tibetan origin and since then <br> has spread to <br> neighbouring countries,along with the influx of the tibetan diaspora.</P>
    <p>Originally,the filling of the dish was typicallymeat,such as YAK,due to scarcity<br> of vegetables in Tibet.</p>
    <p>However, after arriving in other neighbouring countries, the momo was made vegetarian<br> in the modern era to feed the large population of vegatraian.</P>

     <li>The dough is rolled into small circular flat pieces. The filling is then enclosed in the<br> circular dough cover either in a round pocket or in a half-moon or crescent shape.</li>
     <li>A little oil is sometimes added to the lean ground/minced meat to keep the filling<br> moist and juicy.</li>
