    <p>The dish is believed to be of Tibetan origin and since then <br>
      has spread to <br> neighbouring countries,along with the influx of the tibetan diaspora.</p>
    <p>Originally,the filling of the dish was typicallymeat,such as YAK,due to scarcity<br> of
      vegetables in Tibet.</p>
    <p>However, after arriving in other neighbouring countries, the momo was made vegetarian<br> in
      the modern era to feed the large population of vegatraian.</p>


    <div id="content">Preparation
    <ol>
     <li>A little yeast or baking soda is added to give a more doughty texture to finished prodcut.</li>
     <li>The dough is rolled into small circular flat pieces. The filling is then enclosed in the<br> circular dough cover either in a round pocket or in a half-moon or crescent shape.</li>
     <li>A little oil is sometimes added to the lean ground/minced meat to keep the filling<br> moist and juicy.</li>
     <li>The dumplings are then cooked by steaming over a soup (either a stock based on bones<br> or vegetables) in a momo-making utensil called mucktoo.</li>
     <li>Those who dont have steamer then also be pan fried or deep-fried after being steamed <br>or just wihtout steaming.</li>
